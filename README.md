# Data-Science-101-Titanic-Survival-Classification
This is my first ever Data Science Project, the resources can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

Titianic is a Classification project where you have to predict whether the passenger survive from the given information.
It is a nice project to start out since there are only two output classes but decent amount of rows and columns for sharpening the feature engineering skills.
In this work my best performance was 79% accuracy and ranked top 12%

Ideal Workflow:
1.EDA (would be to nice to draw histogram using numerical features against 'survived' and 'not survived'
2.Processing for Missing Values and Outliering
3.Data Scaling and Transformation
4.Feature Engineering (especially on the name, tickets)
5.Model Building and Hyperparameter Tuning
6.Ensembling and Stacking
7.Predict and Submit
